## 🎯 My Product Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Users First, Always** 🎯  
Every product decision should improve the user experience. If it doesn't, we shouldn't build it.

**2. Data Informs, Intuition Guides** 📊  
I use data to understand what's happening, but rely on user empathy to understand why.

**3. Ship Fast, Learn Faster** 🚀  
Perfect is the enemy of good. I prefer launching early and iterating based on real user feedback.

**4. Transparent Communication** 💬  
I believe in radical transparency. Bad news doesn't get better with age.

**5. Continuous Improvement** 🔄  
Every sprint is an opportunity to improve not just the product, but our processes too.
